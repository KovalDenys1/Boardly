## 📋 Issue Description

Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) support to make Boardly installable on mobile devices and desktops, providing app-like experience with offline capabilities.

## 🎯 Goal

Enable users to install Boardly as a native-like app on their devices, improving engagement and accessibility.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create web app manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- [ ] Add manifest link to root layout
- [ ] Design app icons (512x512, 192x192, maskable, adaptive)
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline support
- [ ] Cache static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts)
- [ ] Offline fallback page ("You're offline, check connection")
- [ ] Add install prompt UI ("Add to Home Screen")
- [ ] Configure Next.js for PWA (next-pwa plugin or manual)
- [ ] Test install on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Desktop Chrome
- [ ] Add splash screens for iOS
- [ ] Meet PWA criteria (Lighthouse PWA audit > 90)
- [ ] Deploy to production

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Manifest File** (`public/manifest.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "Boardly - Multiplayer Board Games",
  "short_name": "Boardly",
  "description": "Play casual multiplayer board games with friends online",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "orientation": "portrait-primary",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Service Worker** (Next.js PWA plugin or manual):

- Cache static assets
- Network-first for API calls
- Cache-first for images/fonts
- Offline fallback page

**Install Prompt UI**:

```typescript
// components/InstallPrompt.tsx
// Show "Add to Home Screen" banner on mobile
// Dismiss permanently after install or user dismissal
```

**iOS Considerations**:

- Add apple-touch-icon meta tags
- Add splash screens (via media queries)
- Test in iOS Safari (limited PWA support vs Android)

**Next.js PWA Setup**:
Option 1: Use `next-pwa` plugin (recommended)

```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

Option 2: Manual service worker registration

**Files to Create**:

- `public/manifest.json`
- `public/icons/` (various sizes)
- `public/offline.html` (fallback page)
- `components/InstallPrompt.tsx`
- Service worker (auto-generated by next-pwa or manual)

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test install on Android Chrome (Add to Home Screen)
- [ ] Test install on iOS Safari (Add to Home Screen)
- [ ] Test install on Desktop Chrome
- [ ] Verify app opens in standalone mode (no browser chrome)
- [ ] Test offline mode (disconnect network, app still loads cached pages)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse PWA audit (score > 90)
- [ ] Test app icon appears correctly (all sizes)
- [ ] Check splash screens on iOS

## 📊 Estimated Complexity

### S-M (Small-Medium - 1 sprint / 3-5 days)

- Day 1-2: Manifest, icons, next-pwa setup
- Day 3: Service worker, offline support
- Day 4-5: Install prompt UI, testing, iOS polish

## 🎯 PWA Checklist (Lighthouse)

- [x] Uses HTTPS
- [ ] Registers service worker
- [ ] Responds with 200 when offline
- [ ] Has web app manifest
- [ ] Manifest includes name, icons
- [ ] Theme color set
- [ ] Viewport meta tag configured
- [ ] Apple touch icon provided
- [ ] Maskable icon provided

## 🔗 Related Issues

- Improves mobile experience
- Increases user engagement (app icon on home screen)
- Reduces friction (no app store download needed)

## 📚 Additional Context

**Benefits**:

- **Install**: Users can add to home screen (no app store)
- **Offline**: Basic functionality works without internet
- **Fast**: Cached assets load instantly
- **Native-like**: Fullscreen, splash screen, app icon
- **SEO**: Still crawlable by search engines
